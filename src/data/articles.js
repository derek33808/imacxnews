    "content": "<p>According to the briefing session of the fourth grade to the fifth grade last Friday, we learned that in terms of reading, Chinese needs to complete one million words of reading challenges and English needs to complete thirty reading challenges. These reading challenges require us to reasonably arrange our completion progress and track the reading progress throughout the year. This is far from the progress of a book in the fourth grade. The teacher also suggested that everyone should start training their typing and reading skills during the holiday. So please be mentally prepared.</p>",
    "chineseContent": "<p>根据上周五的四年级升五年级的说明会我们了解到在阅读方面中文要完成一百万字的阅读挑战英文要完成三十本身的阅读挑战这些阅读挑战需要我们合理的安排我们的完成进度，并且在整个年度内跟踪阅读进展。这与我们现在四年级一本一本书的进展要拉开很大的距离。老师还建议大家在假期就开始训练自己的打字能力和阅读能力。所以还请大家做好心理准备。</p>",

    "title": "Military News: China's J-15A Fighter Jet Performance",
    "slug": "china-j15a-fighter-performance",
    "excerpt": "Recent developments in military aviation as China's J-15A demonstrates superior capabilities against French fighter jets.",
    "content": "<p>According to what I heard recently, Pakistan is having an India-Pakistan conflict with India and starting a war. Because Pakistan has a good relationship with China, Pakistan bought China's fighter J-15 A, while India heard that France's fighter jets are better than China's, so India bought a French fighter. It is said to be an invincible fighter, but do you know the result? China's J-15 A (with only one fighter) shot down six French \"invincible\" fighter jets, none of which was lost. Now India is falling into a country with a very, very lack of military power. Pakistan's official (Prime Minister) even claimed on its official website that if it had not been for their mercy, they could have shot down 10 French fighter jets. It seems that the strength of our motherland is still unable to resist, and it is only J-15 A. If it is J-20, or even the future J-25, J-30 and J-35, then isn't China invincible? Sure enough, China is the world's largest military power!</p>\n    \n    <p>It is said that the Indian government is now plotting a plan to buy more Chinese J-15A than Pakistan. They think that China's J-15A is like the power of the gods, which cannot be destroyed and is simply invincible. When India lost six \"invincible\" French fighter jets, they even had to be in debt to buy China's J-15 A. I wonder if India can defeat Pakistan now? Let's wait and see!</p>\n    \n    <p>Think about two questions: If Pakistan had bought a J-20 or something else at that time, what would have been \"interesting\"? If China does not sell the J-15 A to India, will India explode?</p>",
    "chineseContent": "<p>据报最近听说的情况，巴基斯坦正在和印度发生一个印巴冲突并且开始打仗了。因为巴基斯坦和中国关系比较好，所以巴基斯坦购买了中国的战斗机歼15 A，而印度听说法国的战斗机号称比中国的好，所以印度购买了法国一种号称无敌的战斗机，可是结果你知道吗？中国生产的歼15 A（仅用一架战斗机）击落了六架法国\"无敌\"战斗机而一架都没有损失，现在印度正陷入一个军事力非常非常缺乏的国家。巴基斯坦官方（首相）甚至在官网上宣称，要不是他们手下留情，本来可以击落10架，法国战斗机的。看来我们祖国的实力还是无法抵抗的，而且这只是歼15 A，如果是歼20，甚至未来的歼25歼30歼35，那么中国岂不是天下无敌了？果然中国是世界第一军事大国呀！</p>\n    \n    <p>据说现在印度政府正在密谋一个计划，就是购买比巴基斯坦还多的中国歼15 A。他们觉得中国的歼15 A就跟神明的力量一样，无法摧毁，简直无敌。而在当印度损失了六架\"无敌\"法国战斗机时，他们甚至都要欠债才能买下中国的歼15 A，不知道现在印度能否将巴基斯坦打败？让我们拭目以待！</p>\n    \n    <p>考虑个问题：如果当时巴基斯坦买的是歼20或别的，那么又会发生什么样\"有趣\"的事呢？如果中国不卖给印度歼15 A，那印度是不是就炸毛了？</p>",
